# GtkUI Libraries

This repository holds all of the libraries GtkUI can use. These files were originally generated by the [library generator](https://github.com/GtkUI/library-generator) use the GIR XML files stored in `/usr/share/gir-1.0/`. 

To the people who might ask "Why would you make separate library files instead of parsing the GIR directly?". There are some quality of life changes that I would like to make so that, for example, you can set the text of a label by using an argument rather than a setter. Also, I don't think that I have a perfect design for the library generator. It works, but I'm sort of expecting that I missed some crucial part or that I included something that I shouldn't have. With this in mind, I'd rather the program work with me in those cases so that I can make some manual changes, rather than change how parsing is done because of random edge cases.

Anyways, with that rant over, enjoy :)
